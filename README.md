# Model_deplyment_on_AWS

Project Overview

Welcome to the SageMaker deployment project! In this project you will construct a recurrent neural network for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. You will create this model using Amazon's SageMaker service. In addition, you will deploy your model and construct a simple web app which will interact with the deployed model.
